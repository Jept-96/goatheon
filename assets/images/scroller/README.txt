PLACEHOLDER IMAGES FOR INFINITE SCROLLER

This directory is intended for your image assets that will be used in the infinite image scroller.

Recommended specifications:
- File format: PNG (as specified)
- Dimensions: 300x200 pixels (to match the scroller item dimensions)
- All images should have similar dimensions for consistent scrolling

To add your own images:
1. Place your PNG images in this directory
2. Name them consistently (e.g., image1.png, image2.png, etc.)
3. Update the HTML if needed to point to your specific filenames

The website is configured to look for the following files by default:
- placeholder1.png
- placeholder2.png
- placeholder3.png
- placeholder4.png
- placeholder5.png
- placeholder6.png

You can replace these files with your own images while keeping the same filenames,
or modify the HTML to reference your custom filenames.
