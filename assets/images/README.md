## Image Optimization

For best performance, optimize your PNG images before adding them to the website:
1. Use appropriate dimensions as listed above
2. Compress images to reduce file size
3. Consider using PNG-8 format for simple graphics with limited colors
4. Use PNG-24 for images requiring transparency
