ROADMAP CARD IMAGES

This directory is for images used in the roadmap cards that illustrate each step of the roadmap.

Recommended specifications:
- File format: PNG (as specified)
- Dimensions: 250x150 pixels
- Style: Match the overall design aesthetic (black and white illustrations work well)

Expected filenames:
- card1.png
- card2.png
- card3.png
- card4.png

These images appear in the roadmap cards below each step. You can replace them with your own images while maintaining the same filenames, or update the HTML to reference your custom filenames.
