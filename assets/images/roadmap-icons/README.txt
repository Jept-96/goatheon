ROADMAP ICONS

This directory is for icons used in the roadmap section to represent each step.

Recommended specifications:
- File format: PNG (as specified)
- Dimensions: 60x60 pixels
- Transparent background

Expected filenames:
- step1.png
- step2.png
- step3.png
- step4.png

These icons appear in the circular nodes of the roadmap timeline. You can replace them with your own icons while maintaining the same filenames, or update the HTML to reference your custom filenames.
